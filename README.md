# unconfUROS
The annual [conference on the use of R in official statistics](http://urosconf.org) will take place on the premises of the national statistical institute of Romania May 20-21. We are excited to announce an unconference use of R in official statistics on the day after the uRos conference, so on 22nd of May.

## Motivation
The idea behind the event (similar to http://unconf17.ropensci.org/ for R in general) to bring together useRs from the area of official statistics to work for two days on concrete projects where enhancements would benefit many institutes, organisation,... .

Similar to the idea of the [awesome official statistics software](http://www.awesomeofficialstatistics.org) list, this should complement an abstract top-down approach such as the [common statistical production architecture](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/CSPA/CSPA+v1.5) with fast bottom-up solutions.

## Call for ideas
